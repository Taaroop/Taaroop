- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Faiyaz Siddiquee. Taaroop is my nickname.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematics, physics, and their implementation in programming. Sometimes, I code purely for fun.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to improve my mathematical, coding, and physics understanding by participating in various olympiads. I am continuously trying to learn new concepts and proofs in mathematics and physics.
