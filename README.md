- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Taaroop
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematics, physics, and their implementation in programming. Although sometimes, I code purely for fun.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to improve my mathematical, coding, and physics understanding by participating in various olympiads. I am continuously trying to learn new concepts and proofs in mathematics and physics
